## Hands-on With Google Cloud AutoML

This page will host content, resources and links relevant to running a 3-hour workshop or training session on [Google Cloud AutoML](https://cloud.google.com/automl/) targeting developers. The focus is on **Building High-Quality Custom ML Models with Minimal Effort.** No prior expertise with machine learning or Google Cloud is expected. 

The training series kicks off in Q4 2018 and offered by [Pearson](https://www.pearson.com/us/) publishers through the [Safara Live Training](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/live-training) platform with [Nitya Narasimhan, PhD](https://nityan.me) as instructor.

### What You'll Learn

Machine learning and artificial intelligence are rapidly permeating all aspects of the technology ecosystem across enterprise and consumer domains. Thanks to the power of cloud computing, we now have machines that are trained to see (computer vision), talk (speech), understand (natural language processing) and even translate across different languages.

App developers can take advantage of pre-trained models for these features from cloud platform vendors like Google, integrating them using REST APIs exposed by those cloud ML services.But what if you wanted to have a custom model that was tailored more precisely to the needs and context for your domain -- but weren’t comfortable enough with the data sciences knowledge required to work with TensorFlow or other ML frameworks?

AutoML can help. In this training, we’ll learn what AutoML is, and how we can use Google’s Cloud AutoML products to train custom models for Natural Language (to classify documents), Translation (to interpret queries) and Vision (to label images) with minimal effort.

**Key Objectives**

```
 * Understand ideas behind AutoML like transfer learning and learning2learn
 * Learn about Google’s Cloud AutoML products (Vision, Natural Language, Translation)
 * Walk through the usage of each product with an example application and dataset
 * Do deep dives into key aspects like data preparation & model evaluation
 * Learn how AutoML differs from Cloud ML, TensorFlow & Firebase ML Kit options
```
